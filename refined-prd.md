# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT  
**Product:** Voice-to-Trace Assistant  
**Refined Version:** 2.0 (MVP Scope)  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

### The Big Picture  
The **Voice-to-Trace Assistant** enables agricultural field workers to log harvest and traceability events through voice commands instead of handwritten or manually entered notes. Using **speech-to-text** and **natural language processing (NLP)**, the system transforms verbal statements (e.g., “Lot 234 harvested in Field 5”) into structured data stored as **JSON trace records**, which can be automatically integrated into existing trace management systems.  

This MVP focuses on completing one full end-to-end workflow — from voice capture to data ingestion — providing tangible productivity benefits and immediate reduction in manual workload.

### The Problem We Solve  
Field data recording is traditionally slow, error-prone, and requires duplicate work (spoken notes → handwritten log → digital entry). Voice-to-Trace removes this bottleneck by allowing direct, accurate, real-time data capture using natural speech while maintaining data traceability integrity.

### Target User  
**Primary Persona:** Field Worker / Harvest Recorder  
- Works in the field with limited digital interaction.  
- Needs an easy, hands-free way to log key harvest and field events.  

### Core Capabilities (MVP)
- **Voice Capture:** Record voice and convert speech to text.  
- **Event Parsing:** Extract key entities using NLP.  
- **JSON Creation:** Format captured information into standardized trace records.  
- **Trace Integration:** Send structured output to the Trace system.

### Complexity Snapshot
| Attribute | Rating | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Architectural Complexity** | Moderate | Data pipeline from voice input → NLP → JSON → Trace API |
| **External Integrations** | 2 | Speech-to-text API, Trace ingestion API |
| **Business Logic Depth** | Moderate | Entity recognition & field mapping for trace schema |

### MVP Success Criteria
- A field worker can complete a full data entry via voice (create → confirm → sync).  
- Conversion accuracy ≥ 90% for commonly used harvest statements.  
- All trace events align with Trace schema and are successfully ingested.

## 3. USER WORKFLOW: MVP CRITICAL PATH  

**Objective:** Voice → Text → Parsed Data → JSON → Synced Record  

1. **Ravi logs in** to the Voice-to-Trace portal (browser/PWA).  
2. **Taps “Record”** and speaks: “Lot 234 harvested in Field 5.”  
3. **System transcribes speech** to text using speech API.  
4. **Text runs through NLP**, identifying Lot=234, Field=5, Action=Harvested.  
5. **Ravi reviews structured preview** and confirms.  
6. **JSON record** is generated automatically.  
7. **Record posted** to Trace API endpoint.  
8. **Confirmation message** returned on success.  

---

## 4. BUSINESS RULES  

- Only logged-in users can record or send trace events.  
- Speech recognition timeout: 10 seconds.  
- NLP currently trained for English-language inputs only.  
- JSON schema compliance required (all mandatory fields present).

## 5. DATA REQUIREMENTS  

| Entity | Attributes | Relationships |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **AudioRecord** | id, user_id, file_url, created_at | → SpeechTranscript |
