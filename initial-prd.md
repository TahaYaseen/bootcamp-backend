## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

### The Big Picture  
The **Voice-to-Trace Assistant** transforms how agricultural field workers record traceability data. Instead of manually writing notes on physical pads, workers can simply speak natural phrases like *“Lot 234 harvested in Field 5”*. The system leverages **speech-to-text** and **natural language processing (NLP)** to convert this into structured, standardized **JSON trace records** that can be automatically ingested into existing **Trace systems**. This solution dramatically reduces manual data entry effort, minimizes transcription errors, and accelerates trace data capture from the field.

### The Problem We Solve  
Manual trace logging is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient for field operations. Workers often have limited time and harsh conditions that make typing or writing infeasible. Post-field data entry causes delay and increases the chance of record inaccuracies. Voice-to-Trace automates trace input directly from natural voice, enabling real-time, accurate data capture.

### Our Target User  
* **Primary Persona:** Field Worker / Harvest Supervisor  
* **Goals:**  
  - Quickly record harvest or field events verbally.  
  - Ensure trace data is automatically structured and synced to backend systems.  
  - Avoid errors from manual transcription.  

### Key Features  
- **FR-001:** Speech-to-Text Capture  
- **FR-002:** NLP Event Interpretation  
- **FR-003:** JSON Record Generation  
- **FR-004:** Integration with Trace Platform  

### Complexity Snapshot  
* **Architectural Complexity:** Moderate (NLP pipeline integration + external API calls)  
* **External Service Integrations:** 2 (Speech-to-text API, Trace ingestion endpoint)  
* **Business Logic Depth:** Moderate (NLP entity extraction + validation)  

### Success Criteria  
- [ ] Field workers can record events verbally, and structured data is accurately created.  
- [ ] JSON trace records reflect correct entities (Lot, Field, Quantity, etc.) with ≤3% error tolerance.  
- [ ] Processed records flow seamlessly into the Trace system with no manual conversion.

## 3. USER WORKFLOWS  

### **Workflow: Voice Log to Trace JSON**
1. Field Worker taps “Record Event.”  
2. Speaks a natural sentence (e.g., “Lot 234 harvested in Field 5”).  
3. App captures audio → converts to text.  
4. NLP engine identifies entities: `{"lot_id":"234", "action":"harvested", "field":"5"}`.  
5. User reviews and confirms.  
6. JSON record is generated and auto-sent to Trace API.  
7. Success or error feedback shown immediately.  

---

## 4. BUSINESS RULES  
- Only authenticated users can submit trace events.  
- Speech-to-text timeout: 10 seconds max.
